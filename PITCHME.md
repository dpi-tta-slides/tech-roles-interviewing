# Application Submission 📬
- Submit your application through the company's applicant tracking system (ATS).

- Leverage your network to get around ATS
- Include a cover letter

- Assess your basic qualifications, skills, and fit for the position.
- You might have a phone interview with a recruiter or hiring manager
- Research the company and write down questions beforehand
- Use https://shadowing.ai/ to practice

<!-- this could be a coffee or lunch (especially when from your network)  -->
